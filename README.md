# Cykubed agent

The cykubed-agent is a Python 3.10 app used by the [Cykubed](https://app.cykubed.com) platform to orchestrate the creation of Kubernetes Jobs for Cypress test runs. 

See the [Cykubed support docs](https://support.cykubed.com/how-does-it-work/) for more details on usage and implementation.

While not intended to be used as a standalone project it's a good starting ground if you looking to use the Python Kubernetes bindings, and if you want to understand the difference between the various supported Kubernetes platforms.
